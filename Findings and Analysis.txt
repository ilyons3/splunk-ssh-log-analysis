Findings and Analysis:

Suspicious IP Address: 192.168.202.141
This IP address generated a very high number of failed login attempts (2356), strongly indicating a brute force or automated attack attempt.

The failed attempts were clustered within short time periods, suggesting focused attack bursts rather than random noise.

There were no successful login attempts from this IP, but one login event was marked as undetermined.

Such concentrated failed login activity poses a significant security risk by attempting unauthorized access.

Further investigation is recommended to analyze session behavior and correlate with other security logs (firewall, IDS/IPS, VPN).

Based on these findings, it may be prudent to block or monitor this IP closely to mitigate risk and protect the network.
